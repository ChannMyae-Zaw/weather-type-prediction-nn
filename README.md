# 🌦️ Weather Prediction App

A neural network web application that predicts the weather type (**Sunny, Snowy, Cloudy, Rainy**) from user-provided weather metrics.  
The model is trained with neural networks and achieves **90%+ accuracy** on test and validation sets.  

🌐 **Live Demo:** [Weather Predictor]([https://weather-type-prediction-nn.onrender.com])
